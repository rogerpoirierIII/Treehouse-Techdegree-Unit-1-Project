        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Roger, but I commonly go by Trey because not only was I named after my father, but also my grandfather, making me the third.</p>
        <p>I have always been very interested in learning how all things work and operate, As the internet has progressed over time, I have only become more and more interested in learning how the web works. At this time,  I am becoming more aware and knowledgeable about web development and my interest has continued to grow.</p>
        <p> When I am not discovering new things online, I am always looking for new things to cook! Whether it's baking, grilling, smoking, or roasting, I am always looking for new ingredients to experiment with and new recipes to try. </p>
        <p>When I want to relax, I would usually find a fun video game to play. I also love to spend my time outdoors and be surrounded by nature.  I would say my favorite outdoor activity would be relaxing at a beach and listening to the waves crash nearby.</p>
